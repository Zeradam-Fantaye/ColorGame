# Color Game
This is a color game where the user chooses a color from a list that matches the RGB code. 
The RGB code contains RGB(“red”, “blue”, “green”) in it. 

RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. 
Red, green, and blue can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. 
Levels of R, G, and B can each range from 0 to 100 percent of full intensity. Each level is represented by 
the range of decimal numbers from 0 to 255 (256 levels for each color), equivalent to the range of binary 
numbers from 00000000 to 11111111, or hexadecimal 00 to FF. The total number of available 
colors is 256 x 256 x 256, or 16,777,216 possible colors.

# How to play the game
The player/user should pick a mode option from “Easy”, “Medium”, or “Hard”.
Unless, the default mode will be “Medium” mode. Then, the player/user should guess a 
color of his/her choice that corresponds to the RGB code. If a correct choice is 
made, then all the squares including the top pane will change to the answer’s color. 
If an incorrect choice is made, then the chosen square will black out and you will be 
remaining with other square choices.
